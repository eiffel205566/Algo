My personal journey to tackle the inifite possibilities of algorithm

#1 Having fun with the "coins":
Met this problem during an interview, figure I would write my dynamic programming solution down
Most solution found online would just output the minimum number of coin, the solution in coinProblemDP.js
output the actual combination of coin used to get a specific number.
